# ARfolio - AR-enabled Portfolio Cards

<br>

#### Description
ARfolio is my final year research project that transforms traditional resumes into interactive AR experiences. Designed for the IT community, ARfolio enables professionals to showcase their qualifications using a WebAR-based portfolio triggered by a multi-functional QR code.

The system includes a web platform for users to manage portfolio content and a WebAR application that launches directly in the browser, eliminating the need for installing third-party AR applications to view the AR content. It supports dynamic updates, allowing users to modify their portfolios without re-sharing the AR-enabled portfolio card. The QR code acts as an AR launcher, marker, and standalone portfolio card, making it highly versatile.

#### Key Highlights

- Dual interface: Web platform (to input portfolio details) + WebAR app (to view the AR portfolio).
- No third-party app needed (app-less AR approach).
- Dynamic portfolio updates in real time.
- Dockerized microservices deployed on AWS EC2.
